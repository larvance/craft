## Deployment via GitHub Actions (GitHub Pages)

The documentation portal is automatically built and deployed to **GitHub Pages** whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

- **Workflow definition**: [`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`](../.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml)
- **Custom domain**: `craft.larvance.com` (configured via `docs/public/CNAME`)
- **Automated asset sync**: Root `docker-compose.yml` and `scripts/setup-vds.sh` are synchronized into `docs/public/` during the prebuild stage (`npm run prebuild`).
- **SPA 404 fallback**: `docs/dist/404.html` is automatically generated from `index.html` during the postbuild stage to ensure client-side routes and page refreshes work cleanly.
