## 1. Executive Overview

**Craft** is a modular, high-performance server management suite, background supervisor daemon, interactive terminal user interface (TUI) powered by ModalX, and remote orchestration engine designed for Minecraft and dedicated game servers. It bridges the gap between simple command-line wrappers and complex multi-server panels (such as Pterodactyl or AMP), packing full server lifecycle orchestration into a single native binary (<15 MB) with sub-millisecond startup times and a minimal memory footprint (<10 MB RSS for the daemon supervisor).

Craft provides end-to-end server lifecycle management across **21 server platforms** spanning Java Edition, Bedrock Edition, Proxies, and Native Game Engines (Factorio, Terraria, Palworld, Valheim, and Custom Lua/Binary engines). It features typed IPC background supervision, atomic zero-downtime hot backups, cross-platform remote orchestration over SSH, native binary protocol diagnostics (SLP, RakNet, A2S_INFO, RCON), multi-repository plugin/mod management, Zstandard-compressed caching, and an interactive TUI dashboard driven by ModalX.

## 3. Specialized Domain Skill Modules

To maintain deep technical excellence without cluttering high-level documentation, specialized domain knowledge is maintained within individual skill modules under `analysis/`. Each module contains a comprehensive `SKILL.md` detailing implementation rules, algorithms, data contracts, and operational guidelines:

1. **Architecture & Core Mechanics**: [`analysis/architecture/SKILL.md`](./architecture/SKILL.md)  
   Crate dependency boundaries, transactional registry serialization, inter-process locking, path resolution, and error handling architecture.
2. **Daemon & Background Supervision**: [`analysis/daemon-supervision/SKILL.md`](./daemon-supervision/SKILL.md)  
   IPC protocols, circular ring buffer management, stdin streaming, service unit templating, detached process supervision.
3. **Protocols & Networking Security**: [`analysis/protocols-networking/SKILL.md`](./protocols-networking/SKILL.md)  
   VarInt framing, RakNet packet decoding, Valve A2S_INFO query, async RCON client, and programmatic OS firewall provisioning.
4. **Backup Systems & Resilience**: [`analysis/backup-resilience/SKILL.md`](./backup-resilience/SKILL.md)  
   RCON-synchronized save flushes, atomic compression, S3 Signature Version 4 HMAC, Google Drive integration, and restore concurrency guards.
5. **Software Providers & Multi-Engine Parity**: [`analysis/software-providers/SKILL.md`](./software-providers/SKILL.md)  
   21 server engine specifications, dynamic TOML definition packages, bytecode inspection, GC profiles, and multi-game support.
6. **UI/UX & Terminal Modals (ModalX)**: [`analysis/uiux-tui/SKILL.md`](./uiux-tui/SKILL.md)  
   Centered bounded box rendering, `unicode-width` border alignment, readline `TextInput` keybindings, and virtual seek-based log streaming.
7. **Security, Diagnostics & Data Safety**: [`analysis/security-safety/SKILL.md`](./security-safety/SKILL.md)  
   Process lock guards, non-destructive `TrashManager` (files and directories), diagnostic self-healing (`craft fix`), and EULA enforcement.

## 4. Multi-Repository Assessment

- **Current Repository Model**: Craft operates as a unified Cargo workspace containing 11 crates.
- **Standalone Evaluation**:
  - `tools/modalx` is already decoupled into its own standalone Git repository (`git@github.com:larvance/modalx.git`) and published separately to crates.io (`modalx = "0.1.3"`), while remaining synchronized in the workspace for atomic co-development.
  - All other crates (`craft-core`, `craft-providers`, `craft-daemon`, `craft-net`, `craft-plugins`, `craft-backup`, `craft-remote`, `craft-scripting`, `craft-installer`, `craft-cli`) share deep domain interdependencies and benefits from the mono-workspace model.
  - Splitting the remaining crates into separate repositories is **not recommended** at this time, as single-workspace atomic builds guarantee ABI parity and prevent dependency drift.
