# GEMINI.md - Craft Workspace Agent Directives & Operational Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CRITICAL OPERATIONAL RULES FOR ALL AGENTS & COLLABORATORS**:
> 1. **FUTURE-CURRENT-DONE ROADMAP WORKFLOW**:
>    - All engineering work is tracked in [`todo.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/todo.md) organized into three explicit categories: `## Current Phase`, `## Future Phases`, and `## Done Phases`.
>    - **Phase Granularity Standard**: Every phase (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.) must be explained in a **5–10 line technical specification** detailing the objectives, technical approach, prerequisites, architectural trade-offs, and verification strategy.
>    - Once completed, phases permanently transition into the `## Done Phases` category and remain there as an immutable historical record.
> 2. **MANDATORY 5-STEP LIFECYCLE FOR EVERY TASK**:
>    - **Step 1 (Plan Accumulation & Phase Promotion)**: Ensure upcoming work is brainstormed and structured as numbered phases in `## Future Phases`. Promote the active first phase into `## Current Phase`.
>    - **Step 2 (Author Implementation Plan)**: Author an industry-grade, comprehensive implementation plan artifact (`implementation_plan.md`) for the current active phase with `RequestFeedback: true`.
>    - **Step 3 (Wait for User Acceptance)**: **STOP** and await explicit user approval or feedback on the implementation plan before making any source code modifications.
>    - **Step 4 (Apply Plan & Verify)**: Apply the approved implementation plan to 100% completion with zero stubs, running automated tests (`cargo test --workspace`) and compiler checks (`RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --workspace --all-targets`).
>    - **Step 5 (Move Phase to Done & Sync Analysis)**: Move the completed phase from `## Current Phase` to `## Done Phases` in [`todo.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/todo.md), update [`walkthrough.md`](file:///home/usr/.gemini/antigravity/brain/a266ad69-f73d-4c1d-b5d0-e9f0677843af/walkthrough.md), synchronize the relevant `analysis/` documentation, and promote the next phase.
> 3. **CONTINUOUS KNOWLEDGE BASE SYNCHRONIZATION (`analysis/`)**:
>    - The repository maintains an entry [`analysis/analysis.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/analysis.md) file providing a high-level overview of the entire workspace and submodules.
>    - Specialized domain folders under `analysis/` maintain living `SKILL.md` files containing in-depth, professional, niche implementation knowledge that is edited and enriched over time:
>      - [`analysis/architecture/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/architecture/SKILL.md): Crate boundaries, registry serialization, inter-process file locks, error hierarchies.
>      - [`analysis/daemon-supervision/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/daemon-supervision/SKILL.md): IPC framing, circular ring buffers, stdin injection, OS service unit generation.
>      - [`analysis/protocols-networking/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/protocols-networking/SKILL.md): Java SLP, Bedrock RakNet, Valve A2S_INFO, async RCON, OS firewall rules.
>      - [`analysis/backup-resilience/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/backup-resilience/SKILL.md): Zero-downtime RCON flushes, S3 SigV4 HMAC, Drive OAuth, restore lock guards.
>      - [`analysis/software-providers/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/software-providers/SKILL.md): 21 server platforms, dynamic TOML engines, bytecode inspection, GC tuning.
>      - [`analysis/uiux-tui/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/uiux-tui/SKILL.md): ModalX bounded box frames, `unicode-width` border alignment, readline `TextInput`, seek log reader.
>      - [`analysis/security-safety/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/security-safety/SKILL.md): Process locking (`server.lock`), non-destructive `TrashManager`, self-healing `craft fix`.
>      - [`analysis/scripting-automation/SKILL.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/scripting-automation/SKILL.md): Embedded Lua 5.4 VM, execution deadline hooks, lifecycle hook bus, headless CLI automation.
>    - Whenever code in a domain changes, immediately update the corresponding `SKILL.md` to preserve fresh, accurate technical depth.
> 4. **ORGANIZED & NON-REDUNDANT DIRECTIVES**:
>    - `GEMINI.md` is strictly an agent operational directives and workflow governance file.
>    - Do not duplicate extensive line-by-line subsystem audits, code blocks, or file inventories in `GEMINI.md`; refer directly to [`analysis/analysis.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/analysis.md) and the specialized `SKILL.md` guides.
> 5. **STRICT ZERO-EMOJI POLICY**:
>    - Strictly zero emojis anywhere (in source code, comments, documentation, todo files, implementation plans, commit messages, TUI rendering, and user communications). Use clean plain-text indicators (`[x]`, `[ ]`, `[OK]`, `[WARN]`, `[ERROR]`, `[FIXED]`).
> 6. **STRICT GIT OPERATIONS POLICY**:
>    - Agents and collaborators are strictly authorized to perform **stage (`git add`), commit (`git commit`), and push (`git push`)** operations only.
>    - All destructive, history-rewriting, or state-discarding git commands (such as `git reset`, `git revert`, `git checkout --`, `git restore`, `git clean`, `git rebase`, and force pushing `git push --force`) are **strictly forbidden under all circumstances**.

## 1. Project High-Level Overview

**Craft** is a modular, high-performance server management suite, background supervisor daemon, interactive terminal user interface (TUI) powered by ModalX, and remote orchestration engine designed for Minecraft and dedicated game servers.

The workspace consists of 11 Rust crates, a Go distribution server, and documentation portals:
- `crates/core`: Base paths, process locking, Java discovery, LRU zstd cache, non-destructive trash bin, registries.
- `crates/providers`: 21 server platforms (Java, Bedrock, Proxies, Native game engines, and Custom engines).
- `crates/daemon`: Detached background supervisor service, 50k-line circular log ring buffer, typed IPC, OS service unit generation.
- `crates/net`: Pure-Rust SLP, Bedrock RakNet, Valve A2S_INFO query, async RCON client, OS firewall automation.
- `crates/plugins`: Modrinth/Hangar/Poggit search, universal map downloader/resolver, NBT player data inspection.
- `crates/backup`: RCON-synchronized hot backups, local retention, S3/GDrive storage backends, restore lock guards.
- `crates/remote`: SSH connection pooling, interactive PTY streaming, SFTP sync, tri-platform remote bootstrapping.
- `crates/scripting`: Embedded Lua 5.4 engine (`craft.*` stdlib), declarative custom software definition packages.
- `tools/modalx`: Standalone centered TUI modal framework, bounded box frames, readline `TextInput`.
- `crates/cli`: Command-line binary, 30 command handlers, full-screen interactive TUI dashboard.
- `crates/installer`: Standalone ultra-fast self-extracting installer (<35ms install time).
- `server/`: Go distribution server with SHA-256 caching and dynamic install script templating.
- `docs/`: React 18 documentation site with GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

For detailed subsystem audits, trait definitions, and feature implementations, refer directly to [`analysis/analysis.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/analysis/analysis.md).

## 2. Multi-Repository & Submodule Governance

- **Submodules & Subprojects**:
  - `tools/modalx` is developed as a standalone Rust crate and Git repository ([`larvance/modalx`](https://github.com/larvance/modalx)). It maintains its own analysis file in [`tools/modalx/analysis/analysis.md`](file:///D/Projects/craft/tools/modalx/analysis/analysis.md).
  - Skill modules under `analysis/*/SKILL.md` are shared across both the main Craft workspace and the ModalX subproject.
- **Repository Splitting Policy**:
  - If a subcomponent or tool expands to the point where its release cycle or consumer base diverges substantially from Craft (as happened with ModalX), prompt the user to discuss splitting it into an independent repository.
  - The remaining 10 crates in `crates/` share tight ABI and domain cohesion, so they remain unified in the mono-workspace.

## 4. Core Engineering & Invariant Standards

1. **Compiler Warning Denial**:
   - Every crate in the workspace must pass `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo check --workspace --all-targets` cleanly.
   - All tests must pass with `cargo test --workspace`.
2. **Safety-First File Operations**:
   - Never perform unrecoverable deletions of worlds or servers without explicit confirmation or `--permanent`. Always route through `TrashManager::trash_path`.
   - Never restore a backup while a server is actively running (`server.lock` or active PID).
3. **Multi-Runtime Parity**:
   - Do not assume servers are exclusively Minecraft Java. Software edition (`Java`, `Bedrock`, `Proxy`, `Native`) must be honored across Dockerization, start scripts, permission enforcement, and port binding.
4. **ModalX Centered TUI Standard**:
   - All interactive terminal interfaces must utilize `modalx` bounded boxes with dynamic display width calculations via `unicode-width` to guarantee stable rendering and border alignment.
5. **Git Safety Standard**:
   - Only non-destructive version control actions (`stage`, `commit`, `push`) are permitted. Resetting or discarding file modifications is strictly prohibited.
